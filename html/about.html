   I'm Joia Dent, a freelance illustrator and web development hobbyist from and living in Atlanta, Georgia.
   I attended <strong>Georgia State</strong> for a degree in <em>Studio Art</em>. I have always been interested in the internet at large ever since I was a child, and to further my experience in web development and
   coding in general to better my understanding and scope of how to make a good looking site, and work my way into  better career!
